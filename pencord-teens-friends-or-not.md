## Pencord Teens: Friends or not?

Friendship is a bond between two fellows, the fellows are bind together by a tie, it may unknot from time to time; it will eventually knot back again. Alexa Nnamdi-Christian and Andrew Adejomi have that inseparable bond, but if the tie unknots will they be able to knot it back again?Let’s see how the story unfolds.

“Ow!” wailed Alexa, She was playing soccer and the ball hit her leg, badly. Andrew rushed over to her to see if she was okay, he hated when this happened not that she got injured but because the whole class would pair them, saying “Alexa and Andrew sitting on a tree…….” You know the rest and the both of them will remind the class that they were just friends…….just friends yet, no one believed them.

During recess, as the two friends were talking as usual, they saw the banner for the their sets Graduating PromDance, which made them feel awkward, because they always went to dances as friends; this one required couples, they wanted to go badly, but not as a couple, they wanted to go just as friends.

It had been a few days since the awkward incident, Alexa and Andrew hadn’t talked to each other. “maybe if I talk to him he’ll respond.”Alexa thought, 

“I should go talk to her, maybe she’ll respond.”Andrewthought, they were soon looking for each other and found themselves. The both of them talked about how they felt when they saw the banner.

The Prom dance was near and Alexa and Andrew still hadn’t asked each other out.

Two days to the dance and the friends still hadn’t asked each other out. Alexa had gotten her dress and Andrew had gotten his tux. Their bond was so strong they went to each other on the same day that tells you what the power of friendship is.

They met up and this is what happened: “Andrew, I need to ask you something.” saidAlexa “I also want to ask you something ally.” said Andrew, Ally was his nickname for Alexa. Coincidentally, they both said it at the same time “Will you go to the dance with me?”

Alexa and Andrew finally confessed their feelings for each other, in their own awkward way and, finally, kissed. This was the first mouth contact kiss they had in their entire life!

They both went to the dance and everyone was clapping. They soon grew up and started dating, fell really in love and got married.

Friendship can lead to a lot of things like love, misfortune, happiness or the fellows can just stay friends. Love only applies to the opposite gender though.

Reminder: enjoy your friends and be happy. P.S: enjoy your real friends.
