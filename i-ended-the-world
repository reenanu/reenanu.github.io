## I Ended The World
There are lines in this world we don’t seem to understand,
Blurred by the constant need to make a friend.
But when that lined is finally crossed, 
The world finally comes to an end.

You were my end, I cannot lie.
I was addicted I must admit,
The smell of your comfort a pure bliss,
But then again, the world rejected my pleasure, dismissed.

A new rage grew within me,
Nothing like I’d ever known.
Pain engulfed and wrapped me,
Like silk sheets delicately sown.

‘Twas then that I realized, 
It was I that brought my demise.
I am not angry at you,
But I do regret it was you that I knew.
