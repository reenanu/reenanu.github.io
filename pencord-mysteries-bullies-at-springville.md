## Pencord Mysteries: Bullies at Springville

Miserable, Sarah though, was the word that she would use to describe her life, no friends, bullies were there and no teachers to report to, though there were teachers; they couldn’t do anything. “So.”Sarah decided, “I know what to do, I’ll kill myself, there’s no point in life.” Soon the poor girl stabbed herself and dead she lay on her kitchen floor. It took only a few hours for her family to notice and in less than a day, her whole family knew, her school knew, even the police department knew, for they were fond of Sarah.

It was painful. A lot of people wept, all because of bullies, people who made her life miserable, a poor girl had to commit suicide to get rid of the pain, leaving her little brother and sister, Sean and Sandra, who wept deeply about their sister’s death. Again, it was painful.  

Seven years passed, the twins were now fourteen; they still remembered Sarah, they knew she was still in their hearts, so they decided to be a force of good toward everyone, making sure everyone felt good and at home, they soon made a name for themselves, no one dare try to make any trouble

In second term, a new set of students came, friends, their names were Jasmin, Andrew and Tope also known as J.A.T. They made trouble alright, but too many people were afraid; they knew the twins could help, but fear overcame them. Soon, the twins saw them disturbing a seventh grader and dealt with them. The next day, J.A.T was still making trouble and the next and the next, until the twins reported to the principal and the group soon got suspension. They later disbanded.

In year eleven, their last year, they became prefects, Sean was monitoring prefect and Sandra was counselling prefect.

Graduation day came and they soon left the school. Sean got a scholarship admission into Oxford University for his obviously stellar grades, while Sandra got a scholarship admission into StanfordUniversity for herobviouslystellar grades.

Both of thembecame members of a child help organisation, devoted to helping kids overcome mental and physical problems, family trauma and helping homeless kids. 
They soon became popularly known for their good work and shared their story.

One thing that always bothered the twins was the person or people who made Sarah’s life miserable, wanting to give them a talk and try to help them; some bullies may have been traumatised and want to take it out on other people. They thought they could help.
Note to self: Always be kind, helpful, loving and caring, you never know where it may take you.
