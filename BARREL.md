## The Barrel
School was terribly frustrating, Daria thought. She had to finish up an awfully long essay 
 on a drama piece she detested (not really detested, she just never felt drawn to drama pieces), 
 but she would take a famous Shakespearian work over Charles Dickens any day.

So here she was, slaving away on her laptop, at 10:15 pm, racing to meet the deadline in just 
less than two hours, half done with her essay. Half. I was 3000 words.
 
 Alas, she could blame only herself, putting of the assignment until the last minute, where 
 she just happened to remember she had an assignment that her final grade for her literature course depended on. 
 She could do it of course; she wouldn’t have made it this far with her constant procrastination if she wasn’t insanely good.
