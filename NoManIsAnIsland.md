No man is an Island

1.It all started, when the pandemic hit,

2. It threw as all into a fit

3. Human interaction is now gone,

4. What in the world is going on?

5. Quarantine, you name it.

6. This virus has made the world crazy,

7. Infection, death everywhere

8. Can we get through this, maybe?

9. Protests, cries fill the air

10. Police brutality is now here

11. Our youths are trying to make the change, 

12. But our leaders refuse to engage.

13. What has the world become now?

14. A horrible place? I donâ€™t know how

15. This generation has come

16. This is our Fatherland.

17. No more talking and nothing to be done

18. No man is an Island.
